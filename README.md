# flight-map-implementation-cpp
Just a small project in data structures and algorithms class.
//
//
Using readFile() function in source.cpp to cut the flightInfo.txt into 2 files, each contains city name list and the other contains flight routes.
To create a flight map, lets use class FlightMap. Function getCity() of this class is used to get list of cities in .txt file. Function getFlights()  is used get flight routes in another .txt file.
To read the requested file, using function getRequest() in FlightMap class. It will get requestion in a .txt file and print results in console screen.
Hope you enjoy this !!.
